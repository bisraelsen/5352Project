  abstract = {The proliferation of models for networks raises challenging problems
	of model selection: the data are sparse and globally dependent, and
	models are typically high-dimensional and have large numbers of latent
	variables. Together, these issues mean that the usual model-selection
	criteria do not work properly for networks. We illustrate these challenges,
	and show one way to resolve them, by considering the key network-analysis
	problem of dividing a graph into communities or blocks of nodes with
	homogeneous patterns of links to the rest of the network. The standard
	tool for undertaking this is the stochastic block model, under which
	the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely
	of the blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree
	distribution within each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected
	block models add a parameter for each node, modulating its overall
	degree. The choice between ordinary and degree-corrected block models
	matters because they make very different inferences about communities.
	We present the first principled and tractable approach to model selection
	between standard and degree-corrected block models, based on new
	large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of log-likelihood ratios
	under the stochastic block model, finding substantial departures
	from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop linear-time
	approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block
	model and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation. Applications
	to simulated and real networks show excellent agreement with our
	approximations. Our results thus both solve the practical problem
	of deciding on degree correction and point to a general approach
	to model selection in network analysis.},
