Finally, no discussion would be complete without a discussion of
the applications and interpretations of these results on real networks.

For example, one of the most interesting networks seen for both algorithms
is the Serengeti Food Web\cite{Baskerville2011}.

\showgraphwithtitle{Serengeti Food Web}{serengeti-foodweb}

In this network, MDL found 4 solid groups. It seems to have detected
two ``metagroups'', one for each side. Each metagroups is then broken up
into a core-periphery structure with two subgroups. It seems that MDL
has found two ecosystems with their own set of predators and prey.

In this example, VB is not so lucky. It has not detected any structure. This
is very apparent from the complexity curve.

The famous karate club network\cite{Zachary1977} is almost the opposite of the Serengeti
Foodweb. In this network, MDL does not find enough structure to merit the
creation of more than one group. However, VB found enough structure to
find five groups. Like MDL in the food web, VB has found 3 top level groups
of which two are broken into a core-periphery structure.

\section*{Conclusions}

There is no clear winner between MDL and VB. Both algorithms do a reasonable
job on some networks, while not so reasonable on others. The algorithm
of choice is dependent on the desired behavior. We have found that in general
MDL behaves in a more predictable way than VB. This may be exemplified in many of
the previous examples by the variation seen in the VB results. For example, for
some graphs with little to no structure will either cause VB to diverge
into assigning as many groups as there are vertices, or only
one group is detected. MDL on the other hands will always discover just one
group for graphs with inherently little structure.

VB excels at finding many groups, and when $k$ converges, many
high resolution structures may be picked out, generating much more
information than MDL can. In the Karate Club and Dolphins networks
while MDL only picked out two or three groups, VB was able to, in
addition to finding those groups, recurse into those groups and find
subgroups, making it much more flexible as a whole.

With the flexibility VB offers, there a very real possibility of over fitting
the data, which is what was seen over and over again in the previous networks.
With this, MDL is much better at picking out the macro structure of the network
reducing the sway of random noise.
