\begin{abstract}
We have compared two different algorithms for discovering
the number of groups, $k$, in a network given no prior information about the
structure of the network. The two algorithms we have tested in this project are
the Minimum Description Length (MDL) and Variational Bayes (VB).

\section*{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro} In network analysis is is frequently
desirable to identify communities (often referred to blocks, modules, or
clusters \footnote{Cluster detection is not the same as community detection but
is analog in the domain where data are not connected to each other in the style
of networks.}). Community detection involves finding groups of vertices that
are related in some way typically through some kind of similar characteristics,
these properties may not be and in fact are typicall not formally defined. In
other words they may be inferred by the detection algorithm.

Modeling methods like the statistical block-model (SBM) require an estimate of
the number of blocks or communities. Without the use of a community detection
algorithm this task falls on the individual doing the analysis to intuit or
guess the number of communities in the network. Typically this is not a simple
task especially in the case of large real-world networks.

% prehaps put a ridiculogram here to show what a crazy real-wrold network looks like

It is useful then, to have an algorithm that can analyze the network in an
algorithmic manner and identify the number of communities in a graph so that
models like SBM can then be used to model the network and generate other
networks for analysis.

% \emph{original}
% Sometimes, when given a network, it is useful to find community structure in a
% network in order to be able to do further analysis into the structure of the
% network. Many times, little to no prior information is given about the state of
% the network is known. Given this as the case, standard modularity measures like
% greedy agglomeration and the KL heuristic are more difficult to use because of their
% sensitivity to degree such as in the famous Karate Club network.
% 
% To combat this, there are several algorithms used to estimate the number of groups ($k$)
% in a network, an from there, a reduction algorithm may be used to determine the association
% of each vertex in each of the $k$ groups.
% 
% In this paper, we have compared the results obtained from two such algorithms;
% Variational Bayes and Minimum Description Length.

% \section*{Background}\label{sec:Background} Several methods have been proposed
to do community detection. One method that is well known is Modularity
maximization \cite{Newman2004}. However, through much analysis and application
this method has been know to have some drawbacks such as not being able to
recover bipartite structure \cite{Peixoto2013} or recover communities based on
degree structure, and is limited by resolution issues
\cite{fortunato2007resolution}.

Other methods are based around using generative models (such as the SBM) and
then obtain the most likely block model given some criteria. Several of these
methods have also been shown to have resolution
limits\cite{fortunato2007resolution} that inhibit their ability to detect
communities under a certain size. This severely inhibits their use as a general
tool in network analysis and modeling. Another problem with some methods is
that they require other parameters to be known a priori.

Two methods that currently stand out as performing well are the Minimum
Description Length (MDL) \cite{Peixoto2013} and variational Bayes (VB)
\cite{Hofman2008}. Neither of these methods exhibits the resolution limit
problems or require other network information to be known before analysis.

\emph{MDL} MDL was first introduced with application to SBM in
\cite{Rosvall2007}. The key concept of MDL is that the best model for a network
is the model that most compresses it. Thus MDL find the number of communities
that will allow the network to be represented with the least amount of
information. In \cite{Peixoto2013} a general algorithm was introduced to
execute this algorithm on a general network.

\emph{VB} VB was introduced by Hofman and Wiggins in \cite{Hofman2008}. This
method was shown to be the general version several other existing methods.
This method is based on Bayesian methods for model selection. Using Bayesian
techniques then the basic idea of VB is to infer a number of
communities(referred to as modules in the paper) that is most probable and then
infer posterior distributions over model parameters. In the paper VB is shown
to perform better that Modularity specifically with regards to the resolution
limit.

While each of these two methods has been shown to behave well in some
situations there has been little or no work (according to our knowledge and
investigation) that investigates how the differences between these two
approaches may affect their use/desirability in varied real-world networks.

Our aim in this paper is to document our investigation into the similarities
and differences between these two approaches for detecting the number of
communities. Our hope is that this information will help practitioners to
choose between the two methods when applying them to data sets.

\section*{Approach}\label{sec:Approach} Stated again, our aim is to compare the
performance of the MDL and VB algorithms on several simulated networks and some
real networks.

We were able to make extensive use of code produced by the authors of both MDL
and VB \cite{peixoto_graph-tool_2014} and \cite{Hofman_python_2008}. Our first
goal was to re-produce some of the key results from both the papers
\cite{Peixoto2013} and \cite{Hofman2008}, and then as the examples were
different in both papers we compared them against each other.

From there we moved to a deeper comparison between the two methods. Several of
the canonical graph models were used in the attempt to pinpoint or decouple
the effects of specific graph properties on the performance of each of the
methods. The canonical graph types we used are: binary trees, Prices networks
(preferential attachment), random graphs (Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi with fixed degree
vertices, and Poisson distributed degree), block model generated graphs, and a
class of clique-based graphs that are designed as resolution limit tests.

The key result of our work should be considered the value $K$(number of
communities) given by each algorithm. However, in an attempt to more
fundamentally understand the effects of the choices of $K$ we used an SBM to
fit the respective graphs and then analyze the properties of the resulting
communities.

Our results and discussion are presented as follows: first we address the
general behaviors of the two algorithms on simulated networks. From thre we
discuss the results on some interesting real networks.
