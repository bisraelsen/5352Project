This graph begins to exemplify that MDL and Bayes both approach a graph
in a very different way. The difference in philosophy is that the way Bayes
treats a graph which has no structure is to make as many of the nodes as possible
their own group. Notice that the $k$ VB found maxed out. 

The value of the complexity over the number of iterations is shown by this graph.

We can see that over time the complexity never converges over the course of 40 iterations.
This, as far as we can tell, means the graph really does not have any discernible groups according
to Bayes.

Like the Bayes, MDL did not find any discernible groups. This, however, is shown
by MDL as a graph with only one group.
